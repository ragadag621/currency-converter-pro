# Currency Exchange Tracker 💰

This is my first project after returning to the world of programming! It's a dynamic web application that fetches and displays real-time currency exchange rates.

## 🚀 Key Achievements
In this project, I successfully built a functional web app from scratch, focusing on real-time data integration and clean UI.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Structured the content and interface.
* **CSS3:** Designed a responsive UI and handled text-wrapping challenges for complex data displays.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** The core logic of the app, featuring:
    * **Fetch API:** To communicate with external servers.
    * **Async/Await:** For handling asynchronous data flow efficiently.
    * **DOM Manipulation:** To dynamically update the page content based on API responses.

### 🌐 API Integration
I integrated the **ExchangeRate-API** to get live currency data. The app sends a request and processes the **JSON** response to display exchange rates for multiple currencies (like USD, ILS, and EUR) instantly.

### ⚙️ Version Control
The project is managed using **Git** and **GitHub**, showcasing a professional workflow including regular commits and updates.
